// `_clay_custom.scss` is a placeholder for any CSS you want to include at the
// end of `clay.scss`. This file is (oddly) imported at the top of Classic
// Theme's `_imports.scss`, don't recommend using this file. If you need to add
// a third party Bootstrap Theme, just do it in your `_custom.scss` or
// import them using `_imports.scss`.
